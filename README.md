## About me
My name is Aleksandra Belicka. I'm master in Economics, graduated from Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski. I have been working in local government administration for over 8 years. In the Information Security Office, where I have been working for a year, I learned about the application's work in terms of proccesing personal data. That's when I have started to be interested in security and testing. I have the ability to search for errors, which I developed while working as an auditor in the Audit and Control Department. My goal is to develop testing knowlage and technical skills. On this site I would like to share my experience from personal studies and researches.
